Hello ðŸ‘‹ , my name is <b>Oluwafemi Tairu</b>. Human ðŸ˜„, Software Developer with a huge focus on Backend <sup>[[1](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/whats-the-difference-between-frontend-and-backend/#4-what-is-backend-development)] [[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_end_and_back_end#Back-end_focused)]</sup> Development, Occasional Speaker and Writer.

Currently, a Software developer at [GreenPlaces](https://greenplaces.com) and previously, a Software Developer/Team Lead at [AFEX](https://africaexchange.com). My full work history can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oluwafemi-tairu/).

Going through my work history or code you will find out that there is a unique mix of job roles and programming language probably cutting through all major fields in tech. That's a story for another day. I like to see my self as a Programmer or a Full-stack developer with a mixture of other stuff. However, I am much more comfortable working on stuff on the backend, I love Machine Learning and will one day learn stuff on [Augmented reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality).

Whenever I'm not on my laptop coding, I am listening to music, watching movies, discussing with friends or playing games (Chess, Whot! or Ludo).

Have a little something you want to talk to me about? [Send a mail](mailto:tairuoluwafemi09@gmail.com)
