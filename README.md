Hello ðŸ‘‹ , my name is <b>Oluwafemi Tairu</b>. Human ðŸ˜„, Software Developer with a huge focus on Backend <sup>[[1](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/whats-the-difference-between-frontend-and-backend/#4-what-is-backend-development)] [[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_end_and_back_end#Back-end_focused)]</sup> Development, Occasional Speaker and Writer.

Currently, a Backend developer at [AFEX](https://afexnigeria.com/) and previously, a Cloud Developer at [Datamellon](https://datamellon.com/). My full work history can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oluwafemi-tairu/).

Going through my work history or code you will find out that there is a unique mix of job roles and programming language probably cutting through all major fields in tech. That's a story for another day. I like to see my self as a Programmer or a Full-stack developer with a mixture of other stuff. However, I am much more comfortable working on stuff on the backend, I love Machine Learning and will one day learn stuff on [Augmented reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality).

Here are some of the technologies I have worked with or currently work with:

<ol>
    <li>Python/Django/Flask</li>
    <li>HTML/CSS/JavaScript</li>
    <li>Node.js</li>
    <li>VueJs</li>
    <li>Flutter</li>
    <li>Ionic Framework</li>
    <li>C# / Xamarin</li>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>JQuery</li>
    <li>PHP/Code-Igniter</li>
    <li>MySQL/PostgreSQL</li>
</ol>

Whenever I'm not on my laptop coding, I am listening to music, watching movies, discussing with friends or playing games (Chess, Whot! or Ludo).

That's all !!
